Learn how to use our performant on-device NLP APIs to break text into sentences and tokens, identify people and places mentioned in the text (typed, transcribed speech/handwriting). The NLP APIs can be used standalone or as a preprocessing framework for machine-learning based text modeling tasks. The APIs are available in many languages across all Apple platforms, thereby providing homogeneous text processing for consistent user experience. Open up your imagination as we walk you through hypothetical apps that harness the power of NLP to enhance the overall app experience.",
